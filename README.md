# [NCUG] The Lore
## Why theme and stuff is from cyberpunk ?
Well why not , but you can change the tables inside the script to match your gangs and lore . then make a poopwhole of assets for discord.
Or Or listen to this , you can add the gangs from the table to your `qb-core/shared/gangs.lua`
all the CP2077 gangs are there , I will be including the psd file so you can put your own logo on top of assets , but still so much to be done .
